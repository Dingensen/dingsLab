# Bundled with PROJ comes a set of small command line utilities.
# proj: converting between geographic and projection coordinates within one datum.
# cs2cs: similarly to proj, allows translation between any pair of definable coordinate systems, including support for datum transformation.
# geod: geodesic (great circle) computations.
# gie: regression tests in PROJ.
# cct: 4D equivalent to the proj program, performs transformation coordinate systems on a set of input points, has a compontent of time
# projinfo: queries for geodetic objects and coordinate operations.
# projsync: synchronizing PROJ datum and transformation support data.
